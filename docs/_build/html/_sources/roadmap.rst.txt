Roadmap

1.0
---

For 1.0, I want to add to `dcarte` the following capabilities:
- Integrate local project capabilities; that is, enable the development of independent projects with complicated linkages.
- Make sure to include a time series plotting tool because most of what we do is time-related, and it isn't easy to plot time series data when numerous characteristics are present.
Over the previous year, I've looked into most of the possibilities for leveraging Python and other programming languages to construct useful data visualisations on our dataset. The goal for 1.0 is to add plotting capabilities to dcarte that will make it easier to generate these plots.
- Incorporate static interactive dashboards into your strategy:
Creating static dashboards in Python is currently quite challenging due to the limitations of the language (i.e. dashboards require a server, which makes it difficult to share). 
However, I believe that interactivity and dashboarding skills are essential for where I think we're headed. Therefore, I will investigate ways to make static interactive dashboards more straightforward in the future year.
