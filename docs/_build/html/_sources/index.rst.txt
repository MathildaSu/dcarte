Welcome to DCARTE's documentation!
==================================

DCARTE is a tool for ingestion of datasets from DCARTE UK-DRI CAre Research & TEchnology.
As of right now, it is the most straightforward method of gaining access to the ongoing data acquired by the UKDRI-CRT project and the legacy data produced by the TIHM project.  
Dr Eyal Soreq created the platform to unify data-driven analysis across various data domains (e.g. IoT, behavioural, physiological, etc.) generated continuously as part of the CRT ongoing study.  
The study conducted at the UKDRI-CRT aims to advance our understanding of the many behavioural symptoms of dementia and how they are reflected in a set of objective, continuous measures.  
Depending on your needs, this module can be used on either the Imperial College London RDS cluster or a local PC running Python >3.9.
